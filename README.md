# Embedded Software Interface

I developed this project as an Interface for my other projects. Most of my Projects are Embedded Applications or C++ Console Applications, so I needed an Application for visualizing the output of my other Projects.

I used Electron Framework (Node.js) for developing this project. I used other javascript libraries such as jQuery and P5js for creating interactive interface that user can Easily use the Application.

Currently this is the interface of my Projects such as:

* Intrusion Detection System on STM32F4
* Recursive Least Squares on STM32F4
* Single Object Tracking with JPDA
* Object Tracking with Detectron2 & JPDA
* Path Finding with A*


##### Note: If you have problem with SerialPort, you have rebuild with following command:
~~~
./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild
~~~

I'm working on other projects as well, and I will add more features to this project in the future.
